            <p> <b>Overview:</b> The possible future realization of quantum computers poses a serious threat to cybersecurity worldwide. Modern cryptosystems provide no practical security against the threat of quantum computing. Hence there is a need to develop more powerful encryption techniques based on computationally harder problems than those in current use. One promising class of problems comes from the theory of lattices and their associated sphere packings. Best known of these problems is the shortest vector problem (SVP) which provides motivation for the following work. The SVP asks for the length of the shortest nonzero vector in a given lattice. We focus expecially on lattices obtained by restricting the canonical embeddings of cyclotomic fiels in Euclidean spaces to submodules of their integer rings. In this work, we fully characterize the trace forms of all cyclotomic fields (these forms corresponding to the lattice norms of their embeddings), prove a reduction formula for these forms and devise an algorithm for computing their nonzero minima.</p>

                <b>Abstract:</b>In this thesis we investigate the integral trace form of cyclotomic fields. We first show
                that the formula in the general case, that is, cyclotomic fields of any conductor, can be reduced
                to the case where the conductor is square-free. As corollaries, we obtain: 1) a symmetric
                polynomial representation of the form in cyclotomic fields of prime conductor (a result earlier
                obtained by Interlando) and 2) the form in the case of cyclotomic fields of prime power
                conductor. We then use the latter form to produce a succinct algorithm for computing the
                nonzero minimum of the form within a certain submodule of the ring of integers of the
                cyclotomic field. One of the applications of this is in finding the shortest (nonzero) vector of a
                lattice, a classical problem in geometry of numbers.
